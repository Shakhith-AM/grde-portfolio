## What is GRDE?

Most investors know **how much** to save — but not **how to split it**.

The 25x retirement rule gives you a target number. But it never tells you what percentage goes to gold, what goes to equity, what goes to debt. And with Indian inflation running at 6–7%, the 4% withdrawal rate behind the 25x rule doesn't hold.

**GRDE solves this.** It's an asset allocation framework built on architectural principles — layering your portfolio like a building:

| Layer | Asset | Role | Architectural Analogy |
| ----- | ----- | ---- | --------------------- |
| **G** | Gold | Preservation and hedge | Foundation |
| **R** | REITs / InvITs | Income and structural binding | Walls |
| **D** | Debt | Stability and superstructure | Superstructure |
| **E** | Equity | Growth and function | Aesthetics and life |

## Features

- **Age-Based Allocation** — Enter your age, get an instant GRDE split tailored to your life stage

- **Investment Safety Ratio (ISR)** — A single number that tells you if your portfolio is structurally sound

- **Beaver Dam Philosophy** — Inspired by how beavers layer their dams: foundation first, then walls, then reinforcement. Each layer has a purpose.

- **No login. No ads. Completely free.**

## Who Built This?

**Shakhith A.M.** — Principal Architect at i3d Studio, Coimbatore, with 25+ years of experience designing buildings. He asked a simple question: if we blueprint buildings, why don't we blueprint our portfolios?

The GRDE framework applies structural design thinking to portfolio construction — because wealth, like architecture, needs a blueprint.
